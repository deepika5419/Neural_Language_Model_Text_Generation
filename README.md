# Neural_Language_Model_Text_Generation
A language model can predict the probability of the next word in the sequence, based on the words already observed in the sequence.Neural network models are a preferred method for developing statistical language models because they can use a distributed representation where different words with similar meanings have similar representation and because they can use a large context of recently observed words when making predictions.
